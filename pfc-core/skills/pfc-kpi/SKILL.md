# PFC-KPI: KPI Definition & BSC Classification

Define Key Performance Indicators with formulas, thresholds, data sources, and BSC perspective classification. Completes the VSOM>BSC>KPI golden chain by operationalising VSOM metrics and OKR Key Results into measurable, owned KPIs.

## Dtree Classification

`SKILL_STANDALONE` — Low autonomy (structured template workflow), no orchestration, single-concern.

**Path:** HG-01 FAIL (3.3) -> HG-04 PASS (6.5, override from PARTIAL due to 8 sections + 5 gates) -> SKILL_STANDALONE

## Mode Flag

`--mode baseline|monitor` — Controls whether pfc-kpi runs in definition mode or tracking mode.

### `--mode baseline` (default)

Standard KPI definition and target setting. This is the full 8-section workflow described below — identify KPIs from OKR/VSOM upstream, define formulas, set thresholds, classify by BSC perspective, map data sources, and output a complete KPI definition set.

**Use when:** Running pfc-kpi for the first time for an instance, or redefining the KPI set after a strategic pivot.

**Output:** `ve-pipeline-output/06-kpi-{instance}-v1.0.0.jsonld` (full KPI definition set)

### `--mode monitor`

Delta tracking against an existing baseline KPI set. Skips Sections 2-6 (identification, definition, thresholds, BSC, data sources) and focuses on measurement and drift detection.

**Workflow in monitor mode:**

1. **Load baseline** — Read the existing `06-kpi-{instance}-v*.jsonld` as the reference KPI set
2. **Collect actuals** — For each KPI, prompt for or load the current measured value
3. **Calculate deltas** — Compare actual vs threshold:
   - `deltaFromGreen = actual - greenThreshold` (direction-aware)
   - `trendDirection` = improving / stable / degrading (vs prior period if available)
   - `driftFlag` = true if actual crossed a threshold boundary since last measurement
4. **Generate KPI scorecard** — Traffic-light table with actuals, deltas, trends:

   ```text
   | KPI               | Actual | Target | Delta  | Status | Trend |
   |-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
   | NPS Score          |   72   |   70   |  +2    | 🟢     | ↑     |
   | Monthly Churn      |  4.2%  |  3.0%  | +1.2%  | 🟡     | →     |
   | MRR Growth         |  8.1%  | 12.0%  | -3.9%  | 🔴     | ↓     |
   ```

5. **Drift alerts** — Flag any KPI that:
   - Crossed from green→yellow or yellow→red since last period
   - Has degraded for 3+ consecutive periods
   - Has a data source marked as stale (refresh cadence exceeded)
6. **Output monitor report** — `ve-pipeline-output/06-kpi-{instance}-monitor-{date}.jsonld`

**Quality Gates in monitor mode:**
- G1-MON: Baseline KPI file loaded and all KPIs have actuals or explicit "no data" flag
- G2-MON: Every drift alert has a recommended action (investigate / escalate / accept)

**Use when:** Called by pfc-dmaic-ve in the Control phase (`--mode monitor`) to track KPIs against the baseline defined in the Measure phase.

## What You Do

When the user invokes `/azlan-github-workflow:pfc-kpi`, follow these 8 sections in order. Each section has a quality gate that MUST pass before proceeding.

---

### Section 1: Measurement Loading

Load the upstream measurement artefacts that feed KPI definition:

- **OKR output** — `ve-pipeline-output/04-okr-{instance}-v*.jsonld` containing Objectives and Key Results
- **VSOM output** — `ve-pipeline-output/02-vsom-{instance}-v*.jsonld` containing metrics from the strategy framework
- **BSC perspectives** — from BSC-ONT or VSOM BSC strategy map (Financial, Customer, Internal Process, Learning & Growth)

If the user provides a PFI instance name, auto-resolve paths using the naming convention.

Extract and index:
- **OKR Key Results** — each KR with its parent Objective, target value, and measurement period
- **VSOM Metrics** — each metric with its parent Objective, formula (if specified), and leading/lagging classification
- **BSC Perspective Map** — which objectives sit under which BSC perspective

If upstream files are missing, ask the user to run `pfc-okr` and/or `pfc-vsom` first.

**Quality Gate G1 -- OKR Loaded:**
- [ ] OKR Key Results loaded and indexed
- [ ] Each KR has a parent Objective reference
- [ ] VSOM metrics loaded (or user confirms VSOM-only or OKR-only mode)

---

### Section 2: KPI Identification

For each OKR Key Result, determine the relationship to KPIs:

1. **KR IS the KPI** — the Key Result is directly measurable and becomes a KPI (e.g. "Increase NPS to 70" -> KPI: NPS Score)
2. **KPI feeds KR** — the Key Result is a composite or outcome, and one or more KPIs contribute to it (e.g. "Reduce churn to <5%" -> KPIs: Monthly Churn Rate, Voluntary Churn Rate, Involuntary Churn Rate)

Also scan VSOM metrics that are NOT covered by OKR KRs — these become standalone KPIs.

**De-duplication:** Where multiple KRs reference the same underlying measurement, create ONE KPI and link it to all parent KRs. Record the mapping in a KR-to-KPI index.

Present the KPI candidate list to the user for confirmation before proceeding.

---

### Section 3: KPI Definition

For each confirmed KPI, define the full specification:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `kpiId` | `KPI-{INSTANCE}-{SEQ}` (e.g. `KPI-BAIV-001`) |
| `name` | Concise metric name (e.g. "Monthly Active Users") |
| `description` | What this KPI measures and why it matters |
| `formula` | Calculation formula (e.g. `revenue / customers` or `count(active_users, period=30d)`) |
| `unit` | Measurement unit (%, GBP, count, days, ratio, score) |
| `dataSource` | System or process that produces the raw data |
| `frequency` | Measurement cadence (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly) |
| `parentKRs` | OKR Key Result(s) this KPI serves |
| `parentMetrics` | VSOM Metric(s) this KPI operationalises |

**Quality Gate G2 -- KPI Definition Complete:**
- [ ] Every KPI has a formula defined
- [ ] Every KPI has a unit specified
- [ ] Every KPI has a data source identified
- [ ] Every KPI has a measurement frequency set

---

### Section 4: Threshold Setting

For each KPI, define Red/Yellow/Green thresholds and direction:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `direction` | `higher-is-better` or `lower-is-better` |
| `greenThreshold` | Target met or exceeded |
| `yellowThreshold` | Needs attention — within tolerance |
| `redThreshold` | Below acceptable — intervention required |

**Direction validation:**
- `higher-is-better`: green >= yellow > red (e.g. NPS: green >= 70, yellow >= 50, red < 50)
- `lower-is-better`: green <= yellow < red (e.g. Churn: green <= 3%, yellow <= 5%, red > 5%)

**Quality Gate G3 -- Thresholds Valid:**
- [ ] Every KPI has all 3 thresholds (red, yellow, green) defined
- [ ] Direction is explicitly stated for each KPI
- [ ] Threshold ordering is consistent with direction (no contradictions)

---

### Section 5: BSC Classification

Classify each KPI by BSC perspective and leading/lagging indicator type:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `bscPerspective` | `financial` / `customer` / `internal-process` / `learning-growth` |
| `indicatorType` | `leading` (predictive, actionable) or `lagging` (outcome, historical) |
| `causalHypothesis` | Which leading KPIs drive which lagging KPIs (optional, from BSC strategy map) |

**BSC Perspective Guidelines:**
- **Financial** — revenue, cost, margin, ROI, CLV
- **Customer** — NPS, CSAT, churn, acquisition, retention
- **Internal Process** — cycle time, throughput, defect rate, automation %
- **Learning & Growth** — training hours, skill coverage, innovation pipeline, employee engagement

**Leading/Lagging Mix:**
- A healthy KPI set has a balance of leading and lagging indicators
- Leading indicators should outnumber lagging (aim for 60:40 leading:lagging ratio)
- Each lagging KPI should have at least one leading KPI in its causal chain

**Quality Gate G4 -- BSC Coverage:**
- [ ] All 4 BSC perspectives have at least one KPI assigned
- [ ] Both leading AND lagging indicator types are present
- [ ] No perspective has only lagging indicators (must have at least one leading)

---

### Section 6: Data Source Mapping

For each KPI, detail the data collection specifics:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `system` | Source system (e.g. HubSpot, GA4, Stripe, Azure Monitor, internal DB) |
| `collectionMethod` | API pull, webhook, manual entry, ETL batch, calculated |
| `ownerRole` | RRR role responsible for data quality (ref to `rrr:Role`) |
| `refreshCadence` | How often data is refreshed (may differ from measurement frequency) |
| `dataQualityNotes` | Known limitations, lag, or accuracy concerns |

**RRR Role Alignment:**
- Every KPI must have an `ownerRole` that maps to an `rrr:Role` from the RRR-ONT
- The owner is accountable for data accuracy and timeliness
- If no RRR output exists yet, record role names and flag for later alignment

---

### Section 7: Output Assembly

Assemble the KPI definition set into JSON-LD format following KPI-ONT v1.0.0.

**Output file:** `ve-pipeline-output/06-kpi-{instance}-v1.0.0.jsonld`

**JSON-LD structure:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://baiv.co.uk/context/kpi-ont/v1",
  "@type": "KPIDefinitionSet",
  "instance": "{instance}",
  "version": "1.0.0",

    "learning-growth": { "count": 0, "leading": 0, "lagging": 0 }
  }
}
```

**Quality Gate G5 -- No Orphan Metrics:**
- [ ] Every VSOM metric maps to at least one KPI
- [ ] Every OKR Key Result maps to at least one KPI
- [ ] No KPI exists without a parent KR or parent metric (no orphan KPIs)
- [ ] Output file validates against KPI-ONT v1.0.0 schema

---

### Section 8: Validation & Summary

Perform final validation checks and present summary to user:

1. **KPI Count by BSC Perspective** — table showing count, leading, lagging per perspective
2. **Coverage Check** — any VSOM metrics or OKR KRs without a KPI?
3. **Threshold Consistency** — any direction contradictions?
4. **Data Source Gaps** — any KPIs with `manual entry` or `TBD` data sources?
5. **Leading/Lagging Ratio** — actual ratio vs 60:40 target

**Summary table format:**
```
| BSC Perspective    | KPIs | Leading | Lagging | Coverage |
|--------------------|------|---------|---------|----------|
| Financial          |    3 |       2 |       1 | 100%     |
| Customer           |    4 |       3 |       1 | 100%     |
| Internal Process   |    5 |       3 |       2 | 100%     |
| Learning & Growth  |    2 |       1 |       1 | 100%     |
| TOTAL              |   14 |       9 |       5 | 100%     |
```

Report any warnings or recommendations for KPI refinement.
